title: "Why There? Wordnets & Wordclouds"
---

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## What we need here:

- there will be four visuals total shown at any given time
- top two visuals can be "belong", the wordcloud and wordnet
- bottom two visuals can be "don't belong", the wordcloud and wordnet
- extract image if wordcloud hovering does not work
