```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## What we need here:

- create bar graphs for each of the filters
- stack "belong" and "don't belong" graphs
- Add in Plutchikâ€™s Wheel of Emotions to this page on left-hand or right-hand side with supplementary description/info under it (this should be an .md file)
