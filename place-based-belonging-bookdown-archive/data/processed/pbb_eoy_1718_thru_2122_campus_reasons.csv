6,34,NA,NA,1516,1819,us ug,Don't Belong,SRC,this is more on me rather than the experiences i have had at the rec center i am very self conscious about myself and my inferior knowledge of gym equipment and how to properly exercise so i feel as though i do not fit in belong at the rec center
6,34,NA,NA,1516,1819,us ug,Don't Belong,EMU,i am not a very social person and the emu is pretty much all about socializing i am also not a fan of large crowds and it is crowded all the time in the emu i also have a job in the emu and it is difficult to connect with my coworkers

39,223,NA,NA,1516,1819,us ug,Don't Belong,LillisComplex,i associate lillis with business students and i feel the business department has a very conventional typology with it students that are in greek life have no other interests besides partying and tend to be from high income backgrounds
39,223,NA,NA,1516,1819,us ug,Don't Belong,HaywardField,i feel that hayward is associated with extra active people and those that care so much about sports they believe it is integrated into to the welfare of uo students

104,492,NA,NA,1516,1819,us ug,Don't Belong,SRC,i just get really bad gym anxiety so gyms in general unless i am in a guided class make me feel unwelcome honestly the src is pretty great as far as gyms go i just do not like gyms

100,487,NA,NA,1516,1819,us ug,Don't Belong,SRC,the general student here is already fit or is with people finding a time where unfit people can go and not feel like they are being judged for not knowing how to use equipment is difficult i feel as if a widely publicized first timer session where parts of the rec are set aside specifically for the large and for the scrawny
558,514,NA,NA,1516,1819,us ug,Don't Belong,LillisComplex,i hate when i am in a class for the first day and it seems like everyone has a person to talk to and sit next to except me also people are so proactive and organized about their future plans and i feel like i am not

450,1357,NA,NA,1718,1819,us ug,Don't Belong,EMU,other than the food and the fact that my boyfriend works there i tend to avoid the emu because although it is nice for students to meet up and study or socialize with other students and is a good resource for them in that sense i am not a very social person and feel weird being alone studying or eating by myself there because i feel like i should have someone else with me when i do the emu is not so bad to hang out in
509,1469,NA,NA,1718,1819,us ug,Don't Belong,SRC,i am not sure how to describe it mostly i am not very fit myself and sometimes i get self conscious when i am there like i do not know what i am doing and i do not know how to start besides so many of the people there are jacked i am okay when i go there for a class though on my own it a little different

707,4043,NA,NA,1819,1819,us ug,Don't Belong,Library,i feel lost every time i go inside and feel generally uncomfortable anywhere inside the library
707,4043,NA,NA,1819,1819,us ug,Don't Belong,KalapuyaIlihi,i lived in kalapuya prior to moving into riley the residents were all about the same loud inconsiderate and occasionally rude it feels like everyone there thinks of themselves as above others just because they live in the newest hall

710,1551,NA,NA,1819,1819,us ug,Don't Belong,Pacific,i have been taking 200 level chemistry and biology this year and the overwhelming majority of my peers are freshman and sophomore traditional students it is hard to connect with my instructors when our classes are so large and it is very hard to focus when so many young students are having side conversations about parties and extracurricular activities during lecture i am very open to building peer relationships while i am here but i want it to be centered on our student experience since i burned out of the night life scene a solid 8 years ago not many traditional students seem to be keen on having an old buddy whose big friday night is a netflix binge at home and bottle of red wine
710,1551,NA,NA,1819,1819,us ug,Don't Belong,Klamath,this is similar to my experience in pacific in that i do not fit in with many students and they see me as different from them sometimes i feel that they think i am an idiot for being as old as i am and taking the same classes they are it makes it a constant battle to stay motivated in a room full of cliques
710,1551,NA,NA,1819,1819,us ug,Don't Belong,SRC,i am 28 years old and even taking a yoga class last fall made me feel old out of shape and excluded my instructor was the only one i related to but she had back to back classes so i did not have anyone i could talk to in the course all of the students had a lot in common with each other so they generally formed groups easily and i did not feel that my being present had any importance
711,1784,NA,NA,1819,1819,us ug,Don't Belong,Library,people who are smart seem to study there
711,1784,NA,NA,1819,1819,us ug,Don't Belong,GSH,people who are smart seem to live there

717,1685,NA,NA,1819,1819,us ug,Don't Belong,EMU,it just seems like a certain type of people hang out there and it not me i also get stares there when i am with my friends just because we are not part of a type of click
718,2988,NA,NA,1819,1819,us ug,Don't Belong,Klamath,chem lab can be disorienting and feel like a rat race between students that could be working together

1134,6435,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,SRC,since the rec is basically a gym i feel like there is a lot of judgement especially for people who are overweight so that makes it really intimidating to go to

139,602,NA,NA,1617,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,McKenzie,did not have a good memory of class i took in this building
139,602,NA,NA,1617,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,SRC,in my personal opinion people are constantly comparing themselves to others not necessarily in a good competitive way
1219,1980,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Library,sometimes i just do not think that i know where to go in the library i feel that there are not a lot of places to go and everyone looks like they know what they are doing and i do not
1219,1980,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,LillisComplex,i am just not in the building a lot so i do not know many people there
1219,1980,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,McKenzie,i am just not there a lot so i do not know what is going on in that building
162,664,NA,NA,1617,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,LLCNorth,i feel like the area is mostly for freshman students that are much younger than i and have not spent much time there at all in the past 3 years
162,664,NA,NA,1617,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,SciCommons,i am not a student very involved with science and do not feel like i fit in this area
1220,6970,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Bean,bean was my dorm and i never made friends with my neighbors until like the second half of winter term i was pretty introverted and i was actually planning on reaching out to them this term which sucks upstairs i had some friends but then i drifted away from them i did not really vibe with the people there i always felt infinitely more comfortable at my sorority house
1220,6970,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Deady,i am not really a math person and deady feels kinda cursed idk
1220,6970,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,HaywardField,okay i just put that because i could not think of a third building that my bad
484,1413,NA,NA,1718,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,HaywardField,it very exclusive regarding athletes only i feel like a poser
484,1413,NA,NA,1718,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,MattKnight,it overwhelming also not fat people friendly
484,1413,NA,NA,1718,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,SRC,people are fatphobic there i am a fat person
1223,2967,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,SRC,i do not go there often so when i do go there i feel like i do not fit in
898,1556,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Jaqua,it seems like only a place where athletes can go
898,1556,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,SRC,i am not really fit enough and feel self conscious
373,1223,NA,NA,1718,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Allen,allen is bursting with bias i am a moderate conservative student and when i took classes here i felt so uncomfortable and out of place the professors have no filter and will say horrible things in front of students because they assume everyone agrees with their point of view after taking wgs classes here i can assure you the rampant sexism against men was the reason all of the male students in my class dropped this space is incredibly toxic unbearable and one of my least liked buildings on campus
373,1223,NA,NA,1718,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Jaqua,it a beautiful building one of the best on campus but only accessible to athletes really shows who gets priority on campus then you look at my hall lawrence hall and it caked in spider webs cracking lights are strobbing it crowded it looks dirty and maybe even a little haunted i feel like if i am not an athlete or making money for the school i simply do not deserve nice facilities
1225,6323,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Autzen,i do not like watching sports but others do
1225,6323,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,HaywardField,i do not like watching sports but others do
1227,2543,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,SRC,i am not involved with any athletics and do not make us of the center
1228,5830,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,KnightLaw,i had a law class first term and every other student was older more accomplished and it made me feel inferior and nervous
1228,5830,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Library,when i went in for writing tutoring on the fourth floor i was really overwhelmed did not know what to do and felt like i was very small and just ended up leaving
1230,2124,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Jaqua,i am no let into any other part of the building it ugly and does not fit the campus and this building is built explicitly to help a certain subset of students over the rest of the student body the entire building stands for a non acceptance of all
1230,2124,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,LillisComplex,it full of future businessman
623,1399,NA,NA,1718,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,BCC,i am not black
623,1399,NA,NA,1718,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Library,there are a lot of homeless people that are in knight

1232,1321,NA,NA,1718,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Cemetery,kinda creepy
1232,1321,NA,NA,1718,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Jaqua,i feel like there is a strong line drawn between students and athletes at the university
1234,6522,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Walton,i do not have great experiences with people living there
570,751,NA,NA,1617,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Allen,not a journalism major
570,751,NA,NA,1617,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,LillisComplex,i am not a business major
570,751,NA,NA,1617,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,SRC,everyone judges at the rec that why most women or unfit people do not go to the rec
1236,1945,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Deady,i do not feel i belong here because of the math department
1236,1945,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,LillisComplex,it is housed from my old major and gave a very judgy vibe to people there
1236,1945,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,SRC,consistently people judging you
1238,6044,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Frohnmayer,as much as i love the school of music i often feel disconnected i do not feel as if i can even talk to many orchestra students outside of campus orchestra because i grew up not having an orchestra in high school despite being a bassist i really only fit in with band students on top of that i received almost no support from students staff and faculty here when i chose to change my career path from music teacher to instrument technician the majority of people here told me my only option was to become a music teacher otherwise though i do enjoy my time here for ensembles and my piano technician apprenticeship
1238,6044,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Hamilton,despite being a member of the oregon marching band oregon basketball band and the wind symphony i felt very alone amongst those in my class mostly those on my floor i had a number of friends in the pac arc but most of them were not on my floor i felt very outcast from those on my floor and many of those in the pac arc being on the carson plan i did not get to eat in the lobby of hamilton either so it made it so i was hardly ever in the building and never got to mingle too much with those that lived there
1238,6044,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,SRC,i played ice hockey in high school i went to the gym sometimes i was pretty fit i actually like working out and exercising for whatever reason though i feel really uncomfortable when i go here alone i love going to the rec center when i am with friends but i feel very out of place when i go alone i am not entirely sure why anyway i actually love the rec center so long as i am with friends
1239,8317,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Autzen,the people that are at the games are obnoxious most of the students that go only go because it is a thing to go to they do not go to enjoy the actual game also the student tickets are hard to get i still do not even know how to get them from the raffle system the ticketing system is garbage and not user friendly at all it all about the money and not the experience for the students if it were there would be more free student tickets and the season tickets would be a lot cheaper for students
1239,8317,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,GSH,it was always crowded in the dining area so i felt like people were always watching me but that was mostly in my head the dorms also did not feel that inviting they were more like a hospital feel than a living space
1239,8317,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Tykeson,it just seemed to nice for me to be there it was not a place i would want to hangout in for too long if at all
1240,1653,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Cemetery,i often hear of crime reported in this area so it makes me uncomfortable
1240,1653,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,HaywardField,simply because it has always been under construction and not accessible
1241,8108,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Earl,i lived there and i did not find people i vibed with
1242,7090,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,GSH,i felt out of place because i was not as fancy as the people who lived in this hall
1242,7090,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,KnightLaw,i walked in to go study and i felt like the dumbest person in the building because i am a ba student and not a bs student
1242,7090,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Library,i felt like i could not study in this building because it was too quiet
1244,1998,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Klamath,i am not a science person
1245,1961,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,HEDCO,i have only had one class there so i do not really know my way around

1246,6843,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,HaywardField,construction annoying i am not an athlete

1251,623,NA,NA,1617,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Jaqua,not an athlete
1251,623,NA,NA,1617,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Klamath,not typically business students in there
1251,623,NA,NA,1617,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,KnightLaw,not typically business students in there
1252,7704,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Barnhart,it was really far form campus and you could not get in to use meal points unless you lived there
1252,7704,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,HaywardField,it was not open
1252,7704,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,HEDCO,i never had any classes there and it was off of the main campus
215,792,NA,NA,1617,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,LISB,the science buildings in general feel very intimidating for students who are not stem majors
1253,5821,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Autzen,some students are very exclusive with their friends and a lot of people are drunk
1253,5821,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,SRC,people are judgey here and it brings out my anxiety
1254,5237,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Library,too smart
761,2961,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Autzen,the atmosphere is just really aggressive a lot of guys say or do inappropriate things to me and my friends so i have stopped going to games here
761,2961,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,SRC,i am not unfit per se but i definitely get intimidated and uncomfortable by the super ripped guys in the gym that make loud grunting noises when they work out
1256,5431,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,HCT,i do not really know how everything works with insurance and testing and payment and all of that so i usually just go to urgent care
1256,5431,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,SRC,it just intimidating to go into more of a personal problem
1258,3910,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Jaqua,well i am not a student athlete i had classes there but i know for a fact that some student athletes just do not like regular students that alright they can have their own space and world
1259,8085,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,KalapuyaIlihi,i did not mean to click on kalapuya my answer for the previous question would not have any location where i do not feel like i belong sorry
1263,2107,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,LillisComplex,i am not a business major so i am a little uncomfortable here and i do not know my way around the building s
1263,2107,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Willamette,i do not fit in with people usually at the lokey science complex because i am not a stem major
1264,3109,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Frohnmayer,completely different from me
1264,3109,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,GSH,i did not like my experience at gsh i felt very alone my first year
1264,3109,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Pacific,this building is not for people with majors like me it is like entering a new world
557,473,NA,NA,1516,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Jaqua,i do not feel welcome there i went in once and thought the cafe there was really cool but have always been unsure about to what extent non athletes are allowed to interact with the building
557,473,NA,NA,1516,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,OnyxBridge,in all of my years at u of o i never went there i think of it as a very mysterious and exclusive place where only the hardcore science students ever go
1267,6207,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Hamilton,this was my dorm
1267,6207,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,SRC,people judge each other
1269,6122,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,GSH,i dont

1271,5946,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,SRC,i never really went to the rec but i have never been big on working out and i am intimidated by the people who would be in the rec
317,1118,NA,NA,1617,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Klamath,i am not a science student and the science students look down on everyone else
317,1118,NA,NA,1617,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Library,library staff are not the most helpful
118,548,NA,NA,1617,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Autzen,i am not very into football and i have not gone to a game during my time at uo
118,548,NA,NA,1617,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,LillisComplex,i feel intimidated by all the fancy business people
118,548,NA,NA,1617,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,SRC,i worked here for a couple months and the other workers were not very inclusive
1273,4963,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Walton,the people in my hall just were not the kind of people i could open up to or want to talk to
1274,4377,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,KnightLaw,i just have not felt comfortable in there
1274,4377,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,LillisComplex,everyone kind of stares at you when you walk i i just do not feel comfortable in this space
1274,4377,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,SRC,honestly there a community there that does not feel very accepting
1275,4309,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Deschutes,not in science
1275,4309,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Klamath,not in science
1275,4309,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Willamette,not in science
1276,7012,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,LillisComplex,oh man i did not expect to have to write something here i do not really feel comfortable there because of a bad experience i had with someone who is a business major not because of the place itself i specifically avoided the business building while going between classes so i had less of a chance of running into that person
1276,7012,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,SRC,i have been here a few times with friends but never quite felt it was where i enjoyed being it a self esteem thing i am the antithesis of an athletic person and being around people who are is intimidating so after a while i stopped tagging along with my friends when they went there
1277,3227,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Cemetery,its creepy
1277,3227,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Jaqua,i am not a student athelete
1277,3227,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,MattKnight,i do not go there often and have only been once
1278,8066,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,HaywardField,it just not my type of place sports are not my thing
1278,8066,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,MattKnight,again i just do not like sports that much and do not feel like i belong to those areas of campus
1278,8066,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,SRC,i feel like a fish out of water there i am just not there often and i am not super into sports so i do not feel connected to anyone there
1279,5063,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Klamath,part of the science buildings which i have never taken any classes in
1279,5063,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,KnightLaw,i have not gone to the law center since it is far from my other classes and not a law student so i do not really think about going to the law center
1279,5063,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,LillisComplex,i just feel disconnected since it is the business complex and i do not have many classes there
1283,3956,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Lawrence,i do not go there often so i feel out of place
1283,3956,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,LillisComplex,i feel like everyone is better than me
1284,6398,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Jaqua,it no secret this building is exclusive for student athletes it just feels odd to me that i cannot get access to a building that was the focal point of my campus tour when i committed to this school it felt disingenuous personally the way i see it is if i can not go in jaqua i do not need to know about how much nicer it is than all the buildings i can access
1284,6398,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,LISB,i am not a stem person so i usually steer clear of the buildings i know i would otherwise have no need for i feel like if i were to go in the lisb i would have no idea where to go what to do or what i would be doing there
1285,6279,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,LillisComplex,i am a shy person and have a lot of social anxiety sometimes it hard to feel like i fit in with a bunch of strangers
1286,3344,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,KnightLaw,it reputation as a law school is a little daunting
387,1247,NA,NA,1718,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Library,it too quiet for my taste i feel like i have to be diligently studying
1288,6404,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,LillisComplex,the building is huge and so many people travel near there all the time it honestly just feels too fancy and serious
1289,5727,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,KalapuyaIlihi,i lived here briefly and did not like the community i also had issues with roommates so i do not have good memories here
1289,5727,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,MattKnight,i do not like sports games and i feel out of place with peers who do
232,851,NA,NA,1617,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Allen,i feel like allen is only for those in the j school and anyone who goes in there doesnt belong
232,851,NA,NA,1617,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,SRC,i feel like i get stared at for not know how to use machines
1290,4865,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,SRC,it is just very odd for me people tend to be in groups but not many of my friends exercise i usually run outside to avoid the treadmill and other equipment
1295,7758,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Bean,i think i accidentally put bean again i never felt like i did not belong there this choice was an accident
1296,702,NA,NA,1617,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Chapman,elitism from honors college students
1296,702,NA,NA,1617,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Columbia,classrooms were incredibly large and never felt comfortable in them
1296,702,NA,NA,1617,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Willamette,i am very poor at science and this was my main area for all mu science classes
1298,8369,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Chapman,people coming out and in to there looked at me funny because of the way i looked it could be for a multitude of reasons but it just felt different maybe they thought i was hot idk i doubt it though haha
1299,7922,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Autzen,i am not big into sports and i know a lot of uo students like football but the stadium is not my scene in general
1299,7922,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,SRC,i do love what the rec has to offer uo students unfortunately i personally feel kind of intimidated here as someone self conscious about their appearance especially in a fitness setting i have a hard time feeling like i belong surrounded by so many people who are clearly much more into fitness
1300,2572,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Jaqua,non athletes are not allowed past a certain point and i just think that bs
1300,2572,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,SRC,i have anxiety and feel like i am more out of shape than everyone else at the rec it an internal issue it not caused by anyone else actions
942,3998,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,HCT,it always felt intimidating to enter and i was never fully sure where to go or whom to talk to i never really felt like i was supposed to be there
942,3998,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,KnightLaw,probably because i am not a law student it felt more posh and perhaps even elitist to be in there

263,945,NA,NA,1617,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,KnightLaw,i feel out of place in this building but i do like the library but even then i feel like i am not welcomed
132,584,NA,NA,1617,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,SciCommons,i am not a stem major so the science buildings feel very foreign to me whenever i am in this area it feels like i am somehow being dishonest
1413,2488,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,BCC,i do not fee excluded from the black cultural center but it not there to support white people like me so i do not feel i have a right to infringe
1416,993,NA,NA,1617,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,LillisComplex,mostly just because my major was not business or a related major i probably had 2 classes in the entire complex through my 4 years so i never became familiar with the building i also never had classes with other students who spent a lot of time here so i did not have much of a reason to be there i also feel like it gets too crowded and there are not a lot places to sit i do not think lillis is a bad building but as a stem major i found the science library and willamette hall to be much more conveniently located near my classes and more of my friends and classmates were there
36,196,NA,NA,1516,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,LillisComplex,i really enjoy lawrence hall as the primary place of learning and studying for me however it hard not to feel embittered or at least a little frustrated when the college of business has such an amazing building and facilities and many other places that focus on the arts and humanities do not
36,196,NA,NA,1516,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,SRC,i really like taking classes and working out at the rec but it hard to feel accepted and not judged when everyone there seems to be really fit and athletic while i have to work hard to stay in shape and also try to have a good time
1417,5542,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Bean,i have been there a few times and i felt like i was being stared at by those who live there or are more comfortable even if i was just walking through
1417,5542,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,LillisComplex,i am not a business major or minor and the building is so open that i will stand out
1418,7904,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Carson,i feel like i can connect with anyone
1418,7904,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Library,everyone here is quiet and i feel awkward in quiet situations
396,1259,NA,NA,1718,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,SRC,i prefer to go to the rec only during women hours to avoid loud gym bros taking up every single piece of equipment i also do not really understand the organization of the rec it huge and there are different courts or specialized areas everywhere and i find it confusing to choose where i should be to do my workouts for example i like to do bodyweight exercise with a partner and it hard to find an empty floor space designed for such a workout
67,378,NA,NA,1516,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,BCC,did not even know it existed
67,378,NA,NA,1516,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,KnightLaw,feels like a very exclusive place
1419,815,NA,NA,1617,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Bean,cause im not a freshman
468,1383,NA,NA,1718,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Autzen,if you dont absolutely intoxicate yourself when you are going to autzen then you do not fit in and you just have to deal with all these loud drunk people spilling things on you shoving you over and throwing up and passing out everywhere
468,1383,NA,NA,1718,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Jaqua,only top university loved athletes are allowed in the mystery box per usual they get preferential treatment nicer facilities and more exclusivity
468,1383,NA,NA,1718,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,SRC,as a female going to the gym is never a truly great experience there is always some guy who is going to harass you or call at you the women hours help but that not really the problem women should not have to go to the gym at a different time so that men can continue to be sexist without getting in trouble
1420,6467,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Hamilton,i feel overwhelmed by the people in this building
1420,6467,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,SRC,i feel intimidated at the rec
1422,5080,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,SRC,the rec preaches being welcoming to everyone but it often feels very exclusive for anyone who anxious about their body but wants to work out
1422,5080,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Walton,it was my residential hall but apart from the ras racs and community director i felt like my identity was not respected i identified as non binary and preffered they them pronouns something that my fellow residents refused to respect there a complete lack of responsibility for garbage and making messes in the community bathroom and showers plus there a sense of ganging up against students who did not fit in with the in group of the hall
120,550,NA,NA,1617,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,HaywardField,i am not atheletic
120,550,NA,NA,1617,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,MattKnight,i am not atheletic and not into basketball

117,534,NA,NA,1516,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Autzen,see above
117,534,NA,NA,1516,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,HaywardField,i am not interested in sports so it kinda sucks to go to an athletics academy that happens to have a computer science program
117,534,NA,NA,1516,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Willamette,everybody seems to have an idea of what they want or are able to do amazing things in their field but in willamette and most of my other classes i feel like someone who can not do anything correctly
1425,6676,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Autzen,i do not drink
591,561,NA,NA,1617,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Frohnmayer,i am a human physiology major and have nothing to do with music
1432,4854,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,LLCNorth,i just didnt go there very often and there were always lots of people and i felt awkward but i always feel awkward
1436,4701,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,LillisComplex,i have never really been inside lillis and it always seems so busy so i think i would feel overwhelmed not knowing the buidling well
1437,1595,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Library,it is just too quiet in here which is the whole idea of the library but every time i go into the library to study i just feel out of place and like i am doing something wrong
1437,1595,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,LillisComplex,every time i have hung out or had a class in lillis i always feel unaccepted by the students and faculty it is a beautiful building although the people and faculty that inhibit it are not
1437,1595,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Straub,i am a psychology major although i hate the major itself and i wish that i had changed my major before it was too late and i do not feel accepted by the major some of the professors faculty and my peers and this building is only a reminder of that
765,1693,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,LillisComplex,i did not feel welcome and as an outsider clerks and faculty avoided eye contact and were not open for a conversation to assist with any questions they were non supportive and stiff which left me feeling not accepted this resulted in my decision to drop my business minor
765,1693,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,SpencerView,i was a off campus student and dorm living was not available and slight feelings of disconnected were experienced although these feelings were not impairing basically as dorms were not applicable for my campus life
621,1472,NA,NA,1718,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Autzen,ive never been to a football game and it seems to be filled with sorority girls and frat boys which is not my crowd
621,1472,NA,NA,1718,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Jaqua,this building pretty much assures that the entire campus of students who are involved in uo sports knows how much less they are valued the are buildings without working heat ac and ancient desks but this building has a coffee shop and a fireplace and a moat we can very clearly see the students who are valued on this campus and it is the sports teams
621,1472,NA,NA,1718,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Willamette,i am not a science person and i am deeply intimidated by the building because i have no idea whats going on in there
182,712,NA,NA,1617,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Cemetery,i am not dead yet
182,712,NA,NA,1617,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,SpencerView,i have never been here before so i do not think i would be comfortable constantly being there
318,1119,NA,NA,1617,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,LillisComplex,i am not in bussiness and have trouble relating to some of the students that are
318,1119,NA,NA,1617,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Willamette,i meant to pick the building adjacent for media studies i believe i was in there once and felt slightly judged
1438,1949,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Jaqua,i am not allowed inside because i am not an athlete
189,726,NA,NA,1617,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,HaywardField,with it being so new it seems exclussive
189,726,NA,NA,1617,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,KnightLaw,i dont know what goes on in there and it feels as if you can not study in there unless you are studying law
189,726,NA,NA,1617,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,LISB,i have always wanted to explore in here but seems like you need to be studying science to even enter would like to know what cool study areas there may be in there
1440,4130,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Autzen,because i do not have friends who want to go to games with me every time i go i just see a bunch of people with their friends and i get bummed out because i always come alone
1440,4130,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,HaywardField,never been
1440,4130,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,MattKnight,same reasons as autzen because i do not have friends who want to go to games with me every time i go i just see a bunch of people with their friends and i get bummed out because i always come alone
1441,2877,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Allen,i feel disconnected from allen hall even though i am a j major because i do not feel that i am at the same level of prepared as other j major peers and i do not feel like i am successful enough to feel comfortable in the building
594,872,NA,NA,1617,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Allen,this is not my major and can be intimidating because it is a close community
594,872,NA,NA,1617,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,HEDCO,i have never had a class here and so do not travel to this side of campus often
594,872,NA,NA,1617,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Willamette,i have only taken one class here and it was something out of my comfort zone it felt hard to connect
1443,5462,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Bean,there definitely a stereotype to who lives in bean hall and i do not fit in with that i did not actually live in bean i just never really felt like i wanted to be there or that i would stick out like a sore thumb if i was there
1443,5462,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Jaqua,jaqua feels pretty exclusive and it feels that way for a good reason it for student athletes and so the majority of the uo population is excluded from that it not necessarily a bad thing it just a place where i know that i do not really belong and that i am even not allowed on some of the floors that pretty exclusive in my eyes
1443,5462,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Klamath,i had a bad chemistry class experience here now i just kind of connect that memory and those feelings to this hall
575,724,NA,NA,1617,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,HaywardField,this place creates so much anxiety for me i went freshman year with friends and never went to another football game again the student section was too much for me
1450,2761,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Frohnmayer,i am not musically gifted or interested so i would feel very out of my element there
1450,2761,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,TennisIndoor,i do not play tennis and do not have the coordination to play tennis so i would feel very out of my element there
1452,1583,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,HaywardField,jocks go here
1452,1583,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Huestis,idk
1454,3524,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Jaqua,it for student athletes and i have never been in the building i just feel disconnected from the building and what it used for
1460,4593,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,LillisComplex,same as above
1460,4593,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,SRC,did not feel like any of those but i just had to pick places
1461,5906,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,McKenzie,for one it feels distant from everything but also i had my first math discussion class fall term in mckenzie which i struggled in a lot i ended up doing fine in the class as i am not bad at math but rather i felt out of place the building is also kinda confusing
314,1101,NA,NA,1617,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Jaqua,because i am not a student athlete so i do not get to use any of the resources in jaqua
314,1101,NA,NA,1617,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Oregon,because financial aid and the registrar are always very difficult to work with not understanding and very bureaucratic
1463,6012,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Jaqua,meant only for student athletes and i am not one
1463,6012,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,SRC,have not spent enough time there to acclimate
1464,2895,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Frohnmayer,because i do not like to learn about music and also my roommate is a music major and is very annoying and does not know how to play the instrument he is majoring in
1465,5593,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,SRC,i am not athletic
136,598,NA,NA,1617,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Hamilton,i like hamilton dinning but i do not like its mood it probably because i am an anti social
136,598,NA,NA,1617,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,MattKnight,i simply have no interest in sports however it seems like almost all college students are crazy about sports i do not understand it
136,598,NA,NA,1617,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,SRC,i just do not feel like i can be there i have a feeling that people might think i am a weirdo if i try to do something there
795,1586,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Lawrence,because even though i consider myself an artist i feel like i do not look like other students here and rarely ever interact with people even though i try to put myself out there
795,1586,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,SRC,because i do not fit the typical appearance of people who go to the rec building frequently

1467,6924,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,LillisComplex,people are very focused and a bit cold to others not majoring or minoring in business
440,1334,NA,NA,1718,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Cascade,i am not a science related major and i felt out of place being there
440,1334,NA,NA,1718,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Jaqua,i am not a student athlete and as i understand it this building is for student athletes
1469,3554,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Library,i am not quite sure just seems like i would be judged or watched
1469,3554,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,LillisComplex,i feel like lillis is where all the smart students go and have classes and i do not feel like i fit in there
1469,3554,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,SRC,i am feel as if i am not physically fit and i feel as if i would be judged for going in there or working out

1473,1899,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,SRC,i do not like working out around other people
1476,4350,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Autzen,the student section a little too wild for me i enjoy the games but the way the other students act is not really my thing
1476,4350,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Library,i just do not like to study in places where people may look at me in a certain way or stare so unless i get a private room i am not gonna go
1476,4350,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,LillisComplex,i look at all the other business students and none of them look like me so i have that disconnect and they always talk about all their experiences and opportunities that i never even thought were possible growing up
1478,7549,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,SRC,since i do not have any experience in gyms or a lot of knowledge surrounding gym workouts i often feel intimidated by the people who are more regulars there
1479,2236,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,MattKnight,it just seems that this is not really part of campus but more of a business for outside campus
1482,6892,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Library,i think its mainly because i do not know my way around the place and how to utilize the library as an essential tool in my time at uo its kind of intimidating
1482,6892,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,LillisComplex,there an overwhelming amount of people that gives me the craziest amount of anxiety also because i feel like i do not fit in with the people i see lounging in lillis
1482,6892,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,SRC,i feel like i have not gotten familiar with the way it works and how i can properly access the rec but it does catch my attention and i want to use it to take zumba classes yoga etc
1484,5874,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,HEDCO,i rarely saw students here
1484,5874,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,KnightLaw,i never saw students going there and did not feel a need to go
1484,5874,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,LillisComplex,i felt like only upperclassmen or business students were here
1485,8274,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,HaywardField,because it is a waste of money
1488,5362,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,LillisComplex,the classes are always so big and i do not relate to business majors so it ai not for me
1488,5362,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Willamette,honestly i just hated my biology class that i had in this building and the teacher kinda did not know what he was doing so it highkey triggering
450,1357,NA,NA,1718,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Allen,all majors become very cliquey so allen hall feels like a space tailored to just journalism media majors
450,1357,NA,NA,1718,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,LillisComplex,same with lillis it just a very intimidating space that feels tailored to just business majors
579,683,NA,NA,1617,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Autzen,while i loved marching band and my close friends in it i felt disconnected from the larger group and left out of social situations while at autzen the world of sports was too highly connected to partying and social media which i didnt participate in
579,683,NA,NA,1617,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,MattKnight,i dont do well in crowds and dont follow sports
579,683,NA,NA,1617,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Straub,i was a psych major and struggled with finding my place among my peers who largely seemed to have more money and different interests from me i struggled in my classes in straub to keep up socially and was often self concious of my clothes and belongings i also struggled with the amount of of topic technology use that often happened in these classrooms
1489,864,NA,NA,1617,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Allen,i read the question wrong this is a place i feel welcomed

1503,943,NA,NA,1617,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,LillisComplex,it is seen as a center for business students and i was never a business student
1505,4211,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,HaywardField,fuck uo for building this fuck uo for over working the contractors during the pandemic fuck uo for firing a contractor because they did not feel safe continuing construction during a goddamn pandemic

1526,6215,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,MattKnight,even though i was surrounded by all my fellow students and peers i felt empty and alone in these moments as if i were pretending to fit in and be happy in moments that did not really matter to me

1534,3397,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,LillisComplex,honestly the suits the way the business students dress for their presentations is expensive and feels unusual because i associate suits with a certain oppressive religion that i have left
1534,3397,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,SRC,masculine culture and fitness bros are pretentious makes the building feel off limits for unathletic people

1542,5036,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Jaqua,it seems really fancy and high end something i am not used to
1542,5036,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,LillisComplex,i feel like everyone here was superstitious and if you did not plan on majoring in business then you were not accepted
914,2984,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,LillisComplex,because it has a business major vibe and the building is intimidating
914,2984,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,SRC,because it is an intimidating place i like to workout but find places where i am less seen

1559,5371,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Library,it is very intimidating to go there i feel as if i know nothing about the layout
1559,5371,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,SRC,it has a very specific culture of people there that make it unapproachable and difficult to go there without any knowledge of the layout or how to use the equipment

1577,4349,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Deady,first of all the name it named after a racist white man who is no longer relevant the building is also far away from other buildings and in a dark place of campus where not much light is there being in the building is also not fun as you can mostly only take the stairs which are an absolute pain
1578,4699,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,KalapuyaIlihi,majority of students here have varying socioeconomic status and interest than i do

1588,4140,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Lawrence,never really spent time there did not really have the need to visit this building since it does not relate to my major
1588,4140,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,LillisComplex,although this building is wonderful and nice to study in business is not my major so i did not feel the resources related to me aside from the career center to an extent
1590,6409,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Autzen,many of my friends do not like going to football therefore i usually only go to games with one or two of my friends rather than a big group which many people do

1596,3303,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,KnightLaw,the law center has plenty of law students who can be rude and they often make comments at us undergraduates i am sure it well intended but it seems like they just look down on us when in reality they were once where we are in their lives and we are standing in the same building i have a class in the same classroom they do we are not that different it definitely reinforces the stereotype of all lawyers being mean people and stuck up
1596,3303,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,LillisComplex,the lillis building is large and always full of people there are not many places to sit and when you try to look around you get a lot of glares and stares from people it just not that welcoming

1639,2563,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,SRC,unless you already look skinny or fit friends and i who have tried to work out here have not been treated the best and receive too many stares and comments to continue

892,2512,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Straub,i do not think i clicked straub but the lecture halls here remind me of small fenced in area where cattle come to feed and then be moved to another small fenced while you can laugh at my comparison ask any student how open social and accepting straub is it is not people just fly past each other too and from class and ironically while being one of the most densely packed spaces it is one of the loneliest
892,2512,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Tykeson,it is a place of privilege moreover career advising is so poor on campus for music majors it a waste of my time to participate in those services

1670,6186,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Deady,i just hate deady like make it a museum or something but you should not make people go in there it just sucks its so narrow and stuffy and old and its a cool building but like i said you should make it a museum
1670,6186,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Library,i just do not use the knight library that much and i feel like i do not get as much done there as i would in the emu because it just is super sad and dark inside
1672,2175,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,SRC,it just feels awkward to be there

1678,1550,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,SciCommons,i used to go there a lot because the facilities are so comfortable but being around people who just seemed so much smarter than me started to hurt a lot i changed majors for professional career reasons but the science commons is so saturated with all of the things that make me feel like i failed in science i would just rather not go unless it just stopping in for a latte
1678,1550,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,SRC,i am 28 i am tired i am out of shape and my body shows the wear and tear of student life way more than the majority of visitors to the rec i find being around athletes young fit people thin bodies extremely upsetting i do not even come to the rec for a treadmill because i do not want to be the fat lady over there hogging a machine

1682,3410,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,SRC,i am not a very active person and i feel like a lot of the people at the rec center go regularly therefore they know more about the center more than me which makes me intimidated to go
1685,6459,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Autzen,just not my scene
1685,6459,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,HaywardField,to me it is a symbol of great wealth and inaccessibility for most students the millions of dollars spent on the facility is a glaring symbol of inequity it is hard to be proud of the field knowing that the money used to rebuild it could have greatly changed thousands of students lives
1685,6459,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,LillisComplex,not the kind of people i know associate with

1689,4039,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Lawrence,also not my major or minor so i do not see myself stepping into here education wise
1689,4039,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,LISB,not my major so i will probably never step foot inside
1690,5093,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Jaqua,it was very intimidating to go in there because i did not know how to even open the door and i did not know what it even was then when i finally did go into the cafe it was not too bad but not my go to for sure
1690,5093,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,SRC,i feel fine going there for classes but sometimes i feel stared at when i go in to work out i know how to use a lot of the equipment but the fear of what other people think especially that i will not know how to use it gets to me just intimidated by what other people will think of a plus person working out

1696,1408,NA,NA,1718,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,SRC,i do not think it the rec doing it more of a personal thing i think the staff is really nice and welcoming but it is a little intimidating

1699,826,NA,NA,1617,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Hamilton,same issue with walton but because of the cafeteria so much like a high school so immature
1699,826,NA,NA,1617,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Walton,when i was a freshman i did not love the people on my floor in my dorm dorm life was hard for me in general i felt very outcasted and could not connect with the girls on the second floor

1739,6748,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Library,i feel that i am uncomfortable studying here because i am unsure of the resources and the lack of privacy gives me a little anxiety
1739,6748,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,LillisComplex,i just have not spent a lot of time here and i feel that my interests are so different i also feel that a lot of the people who spend time at lillis are older than me
1741,5331,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,LillisComplex,business major kids are scary and they make me insecure about my major also this building is nicer than any of the buildings for social science so it freaks me out when i see classrooms that are air conditioned and properly equipped
1742,7559,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,MattKnight,i was just very far from the arena living in barnhart it was not necessarily that i was not accepted or did not belong just disconnected physically because we never really ended up going to games
1745,5454,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Autzen,i am not really a person who watches sports so whenever it was game day it felt weird hearing the noise from my dorm room and had to tune it out with my headphones
1745,5454,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Frohnmayer,when i dropped out of wind ensemble winter term due to schedule complications i felt like i was negatively judged from both the students and my professor that i was not working hard enough or was disappointing in me i never felt particularly comfortable entering the music building just to take a lesson and see faces that i recognize i think i was always nervous or sweating mildly
1745,5454,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,HaywardField,us students can not even go in there in the first place and it not aesthetically pleasing to look at aside from being an architect major the tall tower is hideous and is out of touch with the rest of the building

1750,2557,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Library,the classrooms in the knight library are of no issue to me i find them nice but the library itself feels disorganized the way seats are arranged right when you enter the 1st floor of the library are awkward and chairs are often moved or shifted just to be comfortable the computers and bookshelves feel like they are placed haphazardly i wish there was more structure to the layout
1750,2557,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,LillisComplex,i feel that the environment there is very unwelcoming i have only taken a couple classes in this building yet i have almost always felt it was unconnected sort of an uncomfortable place to study or just be in especially the metal chairs

1797,7662,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,HCT,because i have social anxiety sometimes communication in these kinds of places is just difficult
1797,7662,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,SRC,because i have social anxiety and there are a lot of people coming in and out of this area i would like to take advantage of the recreation area so that i could work out but my husband is not allowed to go with me since he not a student and i do not want to work out with other people watching me

1805,5572,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,SRC,i always have general feelings of anxiety at gyms because i am not extremely athletic i still went to the rec often so the feelings of not belonging did not prohibit me from working out
1806,5916,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Bean,mostly just because i did not live on campus my first year so i did not have the dorm life and the dorm connections so whenever i would go there it would take me longer than most to fit in this is my problem w most dorms
1806,5916,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Carson,like i said before it was mostly just because i did not have all of the friendships and connections at dorms no real problem with the dorms themselves
1806,5916,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,McKenzie,only because it was the location of the one class i did not pass my first year just get bad vibes from the place sometimes when i think about it
1807,4672,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Cemetery,as a native american we have a special connection with the dead and certain ways we wish for them to be treated the cemetary is their home and it is open for students to walk around carelessly and loudly this is my own personal cultural belief it is nothing you could change per se i would appreciate perhaps seeing signage that asks passersby to be respectful of the land and do not throw garbage on the ground
1807,4672,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,GSH,i am a non traditional student so i just do not personally enjoy going to the gsh it really only because i am 28 and this building is always alive with activity so for me not involved in any clubs or a part of a social group it gets to be a little akward to say the least the staff themselves are fine service is great i just have a hard time socializing in busy crowds and this building is always busy
1807,4672,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,SRC,i have never really visited here but i try to stay away because i do not really have any on campus friends it mostly due to social anxiety so i do not really enter crowded places unless i have a class there
1808,5556,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,SRC,i do not look like i belong there

1810,3405,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,LillisComplex,because it full of business majors and internships

1814,1933,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,LillisComplex,not really through anything that the university can do about it mostly it that the students who congregate there are from quite different majors than me and usually groups take up whole spaces so though it a nice place to study i usually would only pass through it
213,790,NA,NA,1617,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Autzen,i am the least interested in sports i have never even been inside autzen
213,790,NA,NA,1617,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,HaywardField,i am not the athletic type at all both at the field and the gym i did not feel comfortable at all because i thought i might be stared at for my weight
1819,6451,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,HaywardField,honestly i think it was hard to walk past hayward field everyday and not feel some frustration i see how the university invests so much money into the sports while investment in other areas is lacking i think it can be hard to walk past a state of the art field while residence halls are falling apart or like certain classrooms are old and bathrooms are in disrepair in certain halls i guess that creates a feeling of being disconnected from hayward
1819,6451,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Library,i guess i just felt out of place there i dont think it was any fault of the library or the people who were there i just was not able to find a place there where i felt at peace or where i could concentrate it felt very cold and unwelcoming there i do not get a warm feeling from the library i guess
1821,2767,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Autzen,i have never attended a sporting event as the uo and i do not really feel like i am a part of that crowd the kind of students that are really popular and who are involved with clubs and sports and greek life

955,2764,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,SRC,i do not feel like the typical person that goes to the rec and always feel like i am doing something wrong or that people are staring at me

2092,NA,NA,36,1920,2122,us ug,Don't Belong,SRC,as an overweight student many students can be mean the moment you step inside i e overt comments about you to you or to others around so that you can hear obvious conversations with friends about you and laughing but they keep what they are saying quiet so no one else hears rude student employees
2096,NA,NA,40,2122,2122,us ug,Don't Belong,Library,as a freshman it feels like everyone at the library is there for a better reason than me and i almost feel excluded while in there

2105,NA,NA,49,2122,2122,us ug,Don't Belong,SRC,the general vibe of the rec center is very toxic lots of people working out trying to improve their looks and fit a paradigm of attractiveness doesnt really make me feel safe or welcome the only place i go in there is the rock wall
