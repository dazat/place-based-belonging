282,997,NA,NA,1617,1718,us ug,Don't Belong,Craft,lack of information about this place

539,1520,NA,NA,1718,1718,us ug,Don't Belong,Craft,the craft center just felt like people who do not know how to do pottery should not be in this place
317,1118,NA,NA,1617,1718,us ug,Don't Belong,DuckNest,some employees can seem pretentious and territorial i do not enjoy the superficial aspect of this space
189,726,NA,NA,1617,1718,us ug,Don't Belong,FSL,very intimidating

437,1329,NA,NA,1718,1718,us ug,Don't Belong,FSL,i don t feel connected to fraternity life because of my gender identity and sexuality
328,1148,NA,NA,1718,1718,us ug,Don't Belong,FSL,i am not part of the sorority life so i do not belong there
510,1471,NA,NA,1718,1718,us ug,Don't Belong,FSL,not for me
96,472,NA,NA,1516,1718,us ug,Don't Belong,Computer,i feel like i dont fit into this area because i live on campus and feel like there are other places i could use technology so if i were there it is usually last minute and just a bit awkward
282,997,NA,NA,1617,1718,us ug,Don't Belong,Computer,feels awkward to walk in and work on studies
510,1471,NA,NA,1718,1718,us ug,Don't Belong,Computer,like i can not afford anything
106,494,NA,NA,1516,1718,us ug,Don't Belong,FallingSky,it always crowded and loud i feel disconnected that i have different goals and tasks than my peers
144,613,NA,NA,1617,1718,us ug,Don't Belong,FallingSky,i have never really liked the food service is bad
32,172,NA,NA,1516,1718,us ug,Don't Belong,O,way too many people shouting around the large screen tv half of the time
285,1006,NA,NA,1617,1718,us ug,Don't Belong,O,the same as the inside courtyard listed above it has a very aggressive atmosphere its loud but nobody is talking everybody is in their own bubble and isolated even though it is a public area its eerie and antisocial
411,1281,NA,NA,1718,1718,us ug,Don't Belong,O,i just always see people hanging out in groups when i m studying alone
476,1396,NA,NA,1718,1718,us ug,Don't Belong,O,again cool kids
533,1513,NA,NA,1718,1718,us ug,Don't Belong,O,everyone is just not really open to interacting
506,1463,NA,NA,1718,1718,us ug,Don't Belong,Stairs1,i have tried doing homework right here before and felt judged by those around me

317,1118,NA,NA,1617,1718,us ug,Don't Belong,ASUO.SGES,always feel like im under attack by this organisation
549,1546,NA,NA,1718,1718,us ug,Don't Belong,ASUO.SGES,i do not know what this place is about and i have never been in this place
282,997,NA,NA,1617,1718,us ug,Don't Belong,OP,lack of knowledge about this place and how to access its resources
100,487,NA,NA,1516,1718,us ug,Don't Belong,WC,same as above due to my identity as a male i feel as if i am not accepted in this area
150,631,NA,NA,1617,1718,us ug,Don't Belong,WC,it is a safe space for people like me
247,893,NA,NA,1617,1718,us ug,Don't Belong,WC,being a white male and looking into the women center you can almost immediately tell that you are not welcomed you are made out to be the perpetrator or the assailant without anyone ever even getting to know you or your side of the story
549,1546,NA,NA,1718,1718,us ug,Don't Belong,WC,i am a male so women center may be not welcoming for me
510,1471,NA,NA,1718,1718,us ug,Don't Belong,WC,alone
430,1316,NA,NA,1718,1718,us ug,Don't Belong,WC,im never sure if this is a place where i can just go to study or if i need to know people there
199,755,NA,NA,1617,1718,us ug,Don't Belong,VC,different values i am very anti war anti imperialism etc and that is what the military is based on
100,487,NA,NA,1516,1718,us ug,Don't Belong,LGBTQA3,not associating myself with any of these terms i feel like i shouldn t be allowed to be there or my white male identity makes people make notions about me
150,631,NA,NA,1617,1718,us ug,Don't Belong,LGBTQA3,it is a safe space for people like me
247,893,NA,NA,1617,1718,us ug,Don't Belong,LGBTQA3,the political background and ethnicity that i have is not usually accepted in these communities frequently seen as aggressors and immediately written off as someone who opinions do not count
296,1034,NA,NA,1617,1718,us ug,Don't Belong,LGBTQA3,the current management of this space has made me feel uncomfortable as a queer person the space often feels hypersexual
535,1515,NA,NA,1718,1718,us ug,Don't Belong,LGBTQA3,i am conservative and a straight white male things i have to say here are not accepted and not listened to because of my beliefs even if i am willing to listen to what they have to say
96,472,NA,NA,1516,1718,us ug,Don't Belong,Hallway1stFloor,i meant to click on the multicultural center but i guess in the hallway outside of that area it is hard to fit in there becasuse as someone who is a white cis female that is not a soace for me and therefore it feels like i dont belong over in that area
100,487,NA,NA,1516,1718,us ug,Don't Belong,MCC,being a white male i feel like being here means that people have already made a negative view on me
150,631,NA,NA,1617,1718,us ug,Don't Belong,MCC,it is a safe space for people like me
328,1148,NA,NA,1718,1718,us ug,Don't Belong,MCC,well i am not multicultural just white i feel like if i go in there people will not want me their
353,1190,NA,NA,1718,1718,us ug,Don't Belong,MCC,this space is surrounded by people i do not identify with which makes me feel insecure entering this space
549,1546,NA,NA,1718,1718,us ug,Don't Belong,MCC,i do not like multicultural
353,1190,NA,NA,1718,1718,us ug,Don't Belong,Coquille,the same here as the answers above
144,613,NA,NA,1617,1718,us ug,Don't Belong,DuckStore,everyone is trying to sell you something there literally a duck store on 13th why should there be another in the emu
296,1034,NA,NA,1617,1718,us ug,Don't Belong,Taylor,i find the area uncomfortable and not inclusive of people with disabilities
22,122,NA,NA,1516,1718,us ug,Don't Belong,Fishbowl,there are too many people doing their own thing in a big empty space
40,224,NA,NA,1516,1718,us ug,Don't Belong,Fishbowl,same as above
106,494,NA,NA,1516,1718,us ug,Don't Belong,Fishbowl,i never buy food i always pack my lunch because it much cheaper i feel weird eating my homemade food when everyone else is eating purchased lunches it also too loud for my taste
120,550,NA,NA,1617,1718,us ug,Don't Belong,Fishbowl,too many people
140,603,NA,NA,1617,1718,us ug,Don't Belong,Fishbowl,i do not feel accepted in this area because i often see my former roommate and her friends here they make me feel very uncomfortable and worried
166,676,NA,NA,1617,1718,us ug,Don't Belong,Fishbowl,it just crowded i still feel included
285,1006,NA,NA,1617,1718,us ug,Don't Belong,Fishbowl,aggressive atmosphere antisocial students nobody is sitting together everybody is absorbed by their phone or laptop no communication no apologies no new conversations lonely environment even though its filled with people
411,1281,NA,NA,1718,1718,us ug,Don't Belong,Fishbowl,everyone is always eatin with friends etc
363,1208,NA,NA,1718,1718,us ug,Don't Belong,Fishbowl,same reason as above
476,1396,NA,NA,1718,1718,us ug,Don't Belong,Fishbowl,feels like a spot for the cool kids
533,1513,NA,NA,1718,1718,us ug,Don't Belong,Fishbowl,everyone is just not really open to interacting
523,1497,NA,NA,1718,1718,us ug,Don't Belong,Fishbowl,again there is too many people and i feel stared at and judged
347,1183,NA,NA,1718,1718,us ug,Don't Belong,Fishbowl,lots of people
506,1463,NA,NA,1718,1718,us ug,Don't Belong,Fishbowl,it too crowded here for me to feel comfortable
40,224,NA,NA,1516,1718,us ug,Don't Belong,Courtyard,this is is mostly white
106,494,NA,NA,1516,1718,us ug,Don't Belong,Courtyard,i never buy food i always pack my lunch because it much cheaper i feel weird eating my homemade food when everyone else is eating purchased lunches it also too loud for my taste
140,603,NA,NA,1617,1718,us ug,Don't Belong,Courtyard,i do not feel accepted in this area because i often see my former roommate and her friends here they make me feel very uncomfortable and worried
166,676,NA,NA,1617,1718,us ug,Don't Belong,Courtyard,i feel included mostly everywhere in the emu i chose this room just because it crowded a lot
285,1006,NA,NA,1617,1718,us ug,Don't Belong,Courtyard,it has a very antisocial vibe its very loud and overwhelming yet nobody is really talking to each other it has a very aggressive feel to everybody there and i almost want to say i feel less safe and less comfortable here than anywhere on campus besides the graveyard 10 10 i wouldnt leave anything out of my sight here
296,1034,NA,NA,1617,1718,us ug,Don't Belong,Courtyard,frustrating that the emu is not actually open to students 24 7 as is frequently claimed clear that the uo is not concerned about us
363,1208,NA,NA,1718,1718,us ug,Don't Belong,Courtyard,i have gad generalized anxiety disorder and the amount of people and the unavailability of seating makes me feel extremely anxious and unwelcome it hard to find a quiet private area to eat lunch on campus and this is the worst spot
539,1520,NA,NA,1718,1718,us ug,Don't Belong,Courtyard,there are too many people in this area
523,1497,NA,NA,1718,1718,us ug,Don't Belong,Courtyard,there are too many people which can feel intimidating many stare too much

549,1546,NA,NA,1718,1718,us ug,Don't Belong,Ballroom,if i m right this is a performance place i have never been here for a show
533,1513,NA,NA,1718,1718,us ug,Don't Belong,Ballroom,everyone is just not really open to interacting
247,893,NA,NA,1617,1718,us ug,Don't Belong,MC,the men center as well as the information they put out the comments they make etc makes it clear that they are not a center for all men they are a center for progressive men only conservatism is frowned upon and you are unlikely to receive any help from this center if you fall to the right of the aisle
120,550,NA,NA,1617,1718,us ug,Don't Belong,CSI.RC,i m not that involved at school

1829,8275,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Belong,Womens,during the school year i would go to the women center to print papers it would be often where i came in and whoever was sitting at the front desk would give a very kind greeting sometimes this would not happen i think that seeing all the resources they provide and knowing that they are welcoming of anyone of any demographic including any gender in this place

671,4434,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Belong,AtriumEast,nice place to work on homework and see friends
671,4434,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Belong,OLounge,i spend a lot of time here and i like how there are people there but it also feels secluded
681,1639,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Belong,AtriumEast,i feel comfortable doing my work here surrounded by other students
681,1639,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Belong,Womens,i have had positive experiences here as a woman
979,5585,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Fishbowl,it feels dirty like fast food and i do not eat or study here and no one who i know ever does
979,5585,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,MCC,i am a white person i feel like i am intruding on a safe space
979,5585,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Mills,because i work there and am still getting to know my coworkers who are all very different from me and i know it for people from all over but i still feel white guilt and like i look different and that i am in someone else safe space when i am there
989,8338,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,OLounge,i am naturally shy and the constant crowd in the lounge made me feel like an outsider
1012,1889,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Fishbowl,just always a lot of folks who seem fairly unwelcoming
1012,1889,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,OLounge,just always a lot of folks who seem fairly unwelcoming
1012,1889,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,TaylorLounge,just always a lot of folks who seem fairly unwelcoming
1018,3233,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,LGBTQA3,although it seems to be a place where everyone is welcome it is a place that does not seem welcoming to someone who is not already a part of the community
1018,3233,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,MCC,i am not sure
1018,3233,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Womens,the women center only seems to support one type of view and if someone does not have the same views then they do not fit in
1026,5757,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,MCC,i just do not have knowledge on center and i am unaware of what goes on in there
1031,2651,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Courtyard,it feels like everyone is doing their own thing meeting with friends getting coffee with someone i do not feel like i can just hang out on my own at a table like i need to be doing something social in order to be there
638,1730,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Fishbowl,the fishbowl is always so busy and it always difficult to find somewhere to sit people take up multiple tables for 2 people and are not very respectful of the time of day or the occupancy of the space at the time
1052,5010,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Courtyard,same as the other answer i typically sit alone
1052,5010,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,FallingSky,i never have anyone to go with me and i hate being alone
1052,5010,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Fishbowl,i do not have many friends
1055,6342,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,FallingSky,just not really a place i enjoy it does not always feel super friendly
1055,6342,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Fishbowl,it feels so constricted and i get claustrophobic in there because it as if everyone stares when you walk in and there is constantly these long lines of people to awkwardly move around and navigate through
1140,2846,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,AtriumEast,it feels like everyone stares at you when you walk through here so i would not want to be there
1140,2846,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Craft,the craft center feels like a place only for the elite since you have to pay to do anything since i do not have money i feel like i would not be welcomed in
1140,2846,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,OLounge,since it is frequently taken over by sports it feels like i should not be there
1141,4634,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Courtyard,too many kids i do not like crowds that it
1141,4634,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Fishbowl,the part of the uo culture that is rich upper class unaware of the struggles that other humans face everyday in and outside of the u s and are much more focused on buying starbucks coffee than doing their homework tend to hangout in this area i do not know y all i am paying to be at this university to learn not to get along with kids who are literally still just as immature and self centered as they were in high school you should not be surprised that i do not feel welcome in any given area of campus because the majority of your students are exactly what i just described immature and self centered
1194,6582,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,AtriumEast,mostly its just because of my social anxiety there usually a lot of people here socializing and so its not a place where i can focus or feel easily comfortable
1194,6582,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Courtyard,again just there a lot of people there it really an identity issue but rather that its just a bit nerve racking for me to be there
1194,6582,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Hallway2,when my social anxiety is making me feel self conscious it becomes harder for me to walk normally and comfortably as silly as that may sound this hallway which i have used primary as a connection between the grand staircase and the left part is difficult for me to go down because of that because there are those tables where people are sitting it hard for me not to feel judged when i pass by
1234,6522,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Courtyard,i always feel like people are watching me there
1234,6522,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Fishbowl,i feel like there are always too many people there for me to feel comfortable
1263,2107,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Courtyard,i am usually here eating studying alone so i feel more judged
1294,3441,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Fishbowl,i do not have really any friends on campus so i feel like i stick out sitting and eating or studying by myself
1313,5652,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,MCC,it feels kind of like a clique
476,1396,NA,NA,1718,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,AtriumEast,feels reserved for the more social students
476,1396,NA,NA,1718,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Fishbowl,feels reserved for the more social students
1321,1362,NA,NA,1718,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Courtyard,it is loud and packed with groups of people i for the most part do not identify with ie sorority fraternity members
1321,1362,NA,NA,1718,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Craft,i do not fit the identity of many who frequent the center because i am not an art student
1321,1362,NA,NA,1718,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,FallingSky,it is often full of groups of friends and is not a place i would go to alone
1347,7305,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,MCC,i do not have the same interest that those who go there do
1351,5353,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,AtriumEast,all of the chairs are occupied and i do not know anyone
1370,3091,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Courtyard,i am more introverted and anxious when i am around big groups of loud people that are hanging around with their friends i feel like i do not belong
1370,3091,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Fishbowl,i am more introverted and anxious when i am around big groups of loud people that are hanging around with their friends i feel like i do not belong
1396,8262,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,LGBTQA3,i am a part of the lgbt community but feel intimidated by the visibility of it and feel disconnected from people like me
36,196,NA,NA,1516,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,AtriumEast,this is mostly due to the fact that i do not like large groups but i find it hard to focus or spend time here due to how many people are around all the time
36,196,NA,NA,1516,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Courtyard,this is just a super busy spot and sometimes it gets so crowded its hard to navigate through i am just not a big fan of places where large groups gather
1417,5542,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Craft,i am too scared to go in there since i am just now rekindling my love for art and starting it up again i do not feel good enough to be in there and i do not like looking like i am lost and that i do not know what i am doing
1417,5542,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,MCC,i wanted to be a part of the multicultural center since i am multicultural but when i walked in i felt out of place since i look a lot lighter than the rest of them
1417,5542,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Mills,i was comfortable there since during introducktion i spent some time in there and i was told it was part of the multicultural center but when i visited with my roommate during the school year i got strange stares from people i did not recognize and the person i talked to did not seem to happy that i was there i was looking for the printer since i was told i was able to use the printer for free by the people in the multicultural community
1418,7904,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Craft,i do not feel creative enough and i do not have money for it
795,1586,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Mills,it is always crowded and so i feel like i can not spend as much time as i would like to there
450,1357,NA,NA,1718,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Courtyard,super high traffic social areas on campus i am not a big fan of simply because when you are sitting alone you feel really disconnected or just anti social
450,1357,NA,NA,1718,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Fishbowl,same as the reason above
1500,2975,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,AtriumEast,such a wide group of people and it fees like it set up for people watching
1500,2975,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Courtyard,such a wide group of people and it fees like it set up for people watching
1514,3076,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Courtyard,i do not know why
1523,2234,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,AtriumSouth,same as the fishbowl
1523,2234,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Fishbowl,cloud anxiety i feel like i am being judged just walking through its probably all in my head but i still feel that way
1537,5213,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Courtyard,people are hanging out with their friends and i am usually not with friends in that area
1537,5213,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Fishbowl,people are hanging out with their friends and i am usually not with friends in that area
1537,5213,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,OLounge,people are hanging out with their friends and i am usually not with friends in that area
356,1195,NA,NA,1718,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Fishbowl,i typically do not go to this space because a lot of students who i do not typically fit in with aka greek life members hang out here
833,4257,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Courtyard,i like to get food from there but when i hate eating in public when i am alone
1570,4576,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,OLounge,i feel uncomfortable going in alone since almost everyone is in groups
1574,5545,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,OLounge,it an awkwardly busy space
1595,8065,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,AtriumEast,lots of people all the time
1599,4989,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,AtriumEast,there are always so many people here it stresses me out
1599,4989,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Courtyard,there are always a lot of people here it makes me really anxious
892,2512,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Craft,i feel like the services at a full university should be better here my high school had better craft supplies and management than this and had systems in place which allowed students education and collaboration with the people who work in with said crafts in the creation of the projects which is inherent to growth
892,2512,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,MCC,what does this place even do as a non caucasian student i just see this as the university insurance policy oh look at us we are diverse says the board of caucasians to the young woke and conscious white students while i might be slightly exaggerating the air of truth remains as a pacific islander this place is not accepting of my culture i feel like part of the problem is that the center and the school believes specifically for hawaiian culture that the hawaii club covers this space for native hawaiians it does not hawaii club represents the continued colonization of my ancestors homes and the appropriation of my culture this is seen explicitly in the luau where tiki not even hawaiian tourist tokenisms run rampant devoid of any actual culture meat that brings differents and creativity seen for example in the awesome hispanic activities of the multicultural center
1678,1550,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Courtyard,it feels like a school cafeteria and if given the option i would eat almost anywhere else on campus it discouraging to see so many people with their friend groups and eat alone
1678,1550,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Fishbowl,so crowded so loud so busy it is all of the things that trigger panic in me in one confined space sometimes when it quiet i can sneak in for starbucks but as far as using the space staying in the space absolutely not
1678,1550,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Hallway1,i mean i did not mean to click the hallway i guess the multicultural center i feel like as a 3rd gen immigrant i would like to seek support from this group but i honestly do not want to just look like a white oregonian trying to justify my heritage
1696,1408,NA,NA,1718,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Fishbowl,honestly there is never ever enough seating i also feel like everyone is always in the emu studying or eating with friends so it hard to be alone there
1710,972,NA,NA,1617,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Fishbowl,there is a lot of people
1746,2341,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Fishbowl,it just feels kind of awkward there sometimes and i run into people i dont want to see
1765,1669,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Fishbowl,so many young students i am older and it makes me uncomfortable
1765,1669,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,OLounge,so many young students i am older and it makes me uncomfortable but i have spent time in the back area close to the pizza place
1797,7662,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Courtyard,because i have social anxiety and this is a very social place
1797,7662,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,OLounge,because i have social anxiety and this is a very social place
1805,5572,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Fishbowl,if i am ever in the fishbowl without friends i feel lonely and out of place everyone there is usually eating lunch and hanging out with friends so if i go alone i feel like i do not belong
1824,7414,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Courtyard,just very overwhelming with soo many people gives me anxiety so i avoid
1824,7414,NA,NA,1920,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Craft,always wanted to express creativity but do not have enough knowledge to know if everyone is welcomed there
955,2764,NA,NA,1819,1920,us ug,Don't Belong,Fishbowl,everything always feels so busy and theres so many people with friends and people connecting i feel very left out and overwhelemed
