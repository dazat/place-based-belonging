Because analyses combine data from multiple academic years, some students could have contributed data more than once, but none did. However, students did provide multiple responses for this particular analysis, because it combines responses regarding places that make up the Lokey Science Complex to form an overall representation of the Lokey Complex as a unified place: *n* = `r big_n(nmr_lok_b_i$n[nmr_lok_b_i$n_resps==1])` students provided responses regarding one place and *n* = `r big_n(nmr_lok_b_i$n[nmr_lok_b_i$n_resps==2])` provided responses regarding two places.
